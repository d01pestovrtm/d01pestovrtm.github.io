Curently work in progress. 

I found it cool to have a personal webpage for expanded CV and smth else. 
It will have fun to create a cite. I also want to practice in writing some serious technical articles.

The following will be implemented
<ol>
    <li>Main/navigating page</li>
    <li>CV</li>
    <li>Hobbies</li>
    <li>Coachie</li>
</ol>
